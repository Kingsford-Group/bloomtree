The Sequence Bloom Tree (SBT) is a method that will allow you to index a set of
short-read sequencing experiments and then query them quickly for a given
sequence. The code base provided here is an implementation of SBT written in
C++ and is open source. 

To install using the source:
1. Install gcc (Version 4.9.1 or later)
2. Install Jellyfish (Version 2.2.0 or later)
3. Install SDSL-lite (Version 2.0 or later recommended) 
4. Download the latest version of SBT using Github
5. Compile:
cd bloomtree/src
make
