The Sequence Bloom Tree (SBT) is a method that will allow you to index a set of
short-read sequencing experiments and then query them quickly for a given
sequence. The code base provided here is an implementation of SBT written in
C++ and is open source. 

To install using the source:
1. Install gcc (Version 4.9.1 or later)
2. Install Jellyfish (Version 2.2.0 or later)
3. Install SDSL-lite (Version 2.0 or later recommended) 
4. Download the latest version of SBT using Github
5. Compile:
cd bloomtree/src
make

For further details please refer to the user manual (user_manual/sbt-manual.pdf)

FAQs:
1. Cannot find "bloomtreefile" in the example files.
There is no "bloomtreefile" in the example files. But you can build one using these files "Example SBT Uncompressed Leaves" (http://download.srv.cs.cmu.edu/~carlk/sbt/uncompressedleafSBT.tar.gz).
The steps are:
	- bt hashes [-k 20] hashfile nb_hashes	# create "hashfile", the typical value for nb_hashes is 1
	- ls *.bf.bv > filterlistfile	# *.bf.bv files are from the downloaded example data
	- bt build hashfile filterlistfile bloomtreefile	# create "bloomtreefile" for querying
	- bt compress bloomtreefile compressedbloomtreefile	# create a compressed version that leads to a fater query time
Then you can query using the command:
	- bt query bloomtreefile/compressedbloomtreefile queryfile outfile

2. Which file do I query?
Refer to the user manual, you can query both "bloomtreefile" and "compressedbloomtreefile". Using the compressed file results in a substantially faster query time.
